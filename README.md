# Spotify Music Insights for Audience Engagement & Track Popularity

This project analyzes track-level musical features to understand which characteristics contribute to higher popularity on Spotify. The aim is to translate audio feature patterns into insights that are useful for music producers, playlist curators, and marketing teams.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Identify which audio attributes (danceability, energy, loudness, valence, etc.) are associated with more popular tracks, and interpret these findings in a business and music-production context.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Spotify Tracks Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Rows:** ~100,000 tracks
- **Key Columns:** popularity, danceability, valence, tempo, energy, loudness, track_genre, etc.

## 🔍 Key Insights (What Actually Matters)

| Insight | Business Interpretation |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Tracks with higher **energy** and **loudness** consistently show higher popularity scores. | Upbeat and aggressively mixed songs are more likely to succeed on mainstream playlists and algorithmic recommendations. |
| Popularity is **not evenly distributed**; most songs remain in the low–mid popularity range. | Promotion, playlist placement, and marketing strategy have more impact than genre choice alone. |
| **Danceability** and **valence** (positive mood) correlate with audience engagement. | Music that is both upbeat and emotionally positive performs better in casual listening environments (gyms, cafes, public playlists). |
